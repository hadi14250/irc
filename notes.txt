FUNCTIONS

#include <sys/socket.h>
int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);
creates an endpoint for communication and returns file descriptor that refers to that endpoint
successful - returns lowest fd not in use
error - returns -1
domain - specifies communication domain - selects protocol family (see man)
type - specifies communication semantics. Or more generally, socket type
	-most common is SOCK_STREAM and SOCK_DGRAM
	-type can also be used to modify socket behavior with Values/tags (see man)
protocol - usually only one protocol exists, so default is 0
	-protocol number to use is specific to communication domain (??)
